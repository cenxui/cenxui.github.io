<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Welcome! I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science in National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University. My research is currently focused on Bandit Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Meta Learning, and Optimization for Networks. For more details, please see <a href="research.html">Initiatives</a>.</p>
<h2>To Prospective Students</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>(<font color=red><b>113年度碩博錄取生歡迎來信詢問</b></font>)</b> I am currently looking for highly-motivated students who are interested in either <b>theoretical or system aspects of Reinforcement Learning, Bandit Learning, Bayesian Optimization, Meta Learning</b>, or other related areas. Both graduate and undergraduate students at NYCU are welcome to discuss with me if you are interested in my research. For those of you who are interested in doing cool and principled research, you may also find <a href="orientation.html">Research 101</a> rather useful :)</p>
